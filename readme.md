# Chatbot with AI Integration  

## Overview  
This project is an AI-powered chatbot designed to provide interactive and intelligent responses based on user queries. The chatbot leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and integrates with a backend system to improve response accuracy and relevance.  

## Features  
- Context-aware responses  
- Customizable knowledge base  
- Multi-turn conversation handling  
- API integration for extended functionality  
- Scalable and efficient architecture  

## Installation  

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatbot-ai.git  
   cd chatbot-ai  
   ```  

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**  
   ```bash  
   python -m venv venv  
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS  
   venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows  
   ```  

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

4. **Run the Chatbot**  
   ```bash  
   python main.py  
   ```  

## Usage

- The knowledge base can be customized in `data/knowledge_base.json`.  

## Dependencies  
- Python 3.x  
- Flask (if a web interface is included)  
- NLP libraries such as `spaCy` or `NLTK`  
- API integration for external data sources (if applicable)  

## Future Enhancements  
- Implementing a graphical user interface  
- Enhancing NLP capabilities with transformer-based models  
- Integrating with messaging platforms like WhatsApp or Slack
